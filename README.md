# First-website
Building my first website
Website topic: Cats, everyone loves them (or at least they should)
I've made this website because spreading awareness of cats is very important for me.
This is my first website so I hope anyone who visits enjoys all of the information I've put together! ðŸ˜»
The website consists of four pages, all linked by the navigation bar. Each page has a similar style to the home page but they all have varying content and links.
