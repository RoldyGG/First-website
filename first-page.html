            <p>Even though they are cute in appearance, don't let that facade fool you! Cats are actually very intersting creatures because not only are they one of earth's <a href="https://knowinsiders.com/top-10-most-popular-pets-in-the-world-32579.html">favorite</a>  cuddly companions, they are also considered one of the top <a href="https://pictures-of-cats.org/hunting-success-of-wild-cats.html">apex predators</a>  in the world in terms of success rate per hunt! Does that grab your curiosity? Well that's great because I've made this page to share some more information with you about one of my favorite domestic friends: <i>"felis catus"</i>, or more commonly known as a cat! 😺

              <h2 id="catcat">Cats, cats, and more cats!<br> (oh my!)</h2>
            <p>"Well, where's all the info?!" No worries we have you covered, in fact you may have already seen the links at the top of the page. If you didn't that's alright! Just make sure to head up and check out the links for more sweet info, from the domestication of cats to all of the different breeds, the info tab has all the information you need, and then some. 🙀</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="need">Do I need a cat?</h2>
            <p>Did reading all of that information make you want a cat of your own or were you already thinking of adding a friendly feline companion to your life? Say no more, we have you covered on that too!! Even though cats are very independent little creatures like any other pet they have very specific needs in order to thrive in a home environment so I have also added a section for those thinking of sharing a home with one of earth's most popular (and loving) pets. Of course you never want to jump into pet ownership uninformed so make sure you get all the details so that you can be one of the best cat owners of all time! 😻</p>

            <h2 id="curious">Curious for more?</h2>
            <p>After you've checked out all of those resources feel free to check out the "survey" tab located <a href="#home">here</a> at the top of this page.
            Here you can take this short survey on cats, I'd love to know what some of your favorite things about cats! 🐱‍👤</p>
